SmartTrafficAI is a real-time system for detecting vehicles, reading number plates, estimating vehicle speed, and classifying vehicle types (car, truck, bus, bike) using computer vision and deep learning models like YOLOv5.
 
## Features
- Vehicle Detection**: Detects multiple vehicle types in real-time.
- Number Plate Recognition**: Extracts text from vehicle number plates using OCR.
- Speed Estimation**: Estimates vehicle speed based on frame-by-frame movement.
- Vehicle Classification**: Identifies vehicle types such as cars, buses, trucks, etc.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

   cd SmartTrafficAI
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up Tesseract for OCR (number plate recognition):
   - [Install Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)

4. Download the YOLOv5 weights and place them in the `yolov5/` folder.
